# 🎙️ Podcast Studio - Professional Interview Preparation Platform

## 🌟 **Proof of Concept**
*"Experimental podcast episode preparation tool - testing content generation workflows."*

## 🎯 **Status: Learning Project**

Basic PowerShell script for generating podcast prep content. Created as part of InnovPark homework assignment. Still testing and learning.

## 📋 **Current Status: Experimental**

### ✅ **Basic Concept Working**
- **PowerShell Script**: Converts content to HTML format
- **Template System**: Basic HTML generation
- **File Processing**: Image embedding works
- **Test Case**: One successful example generated

### 🤔 **Still Learning**
- Content quality needs work
- Process is manual and slow  
- Not sure about market demand
- Just a homework project for now

## 🚀 **Technical Notes**

### **Current Approach**
```
PowerShell Script → HTML Templates → Base64 Images → HTML Output
```

### **Ideas for Later** 
- Maybe a web interface someday
- Could automate more steps
- Need to figure out if anyone actually wants this

### **Banking Background Thinking**
- File validation patterns might be useful
- Process checking could help
- But this is just a homework experiment
